          To uphold the professional standards of Texas A&M University, we require all current students to register for
          and attend our Professionalism Workshop. There are three workshops, but you only need to attend one.
        </p>

        <p className="no-gap">
          The dates for these workshops are as follows:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong><a href={professionalismWorkshops.fallLink} className="link" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Fall {fairTimes.yearStart}</a></strong>

          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Current students are <strong>required to attend one workshop</strong> if they wish to attend any of the portfolio reviews,
          mock interviews, or the virtual/in-person industry fair. The workshops are virtual via Zoom.
          Students who register for the workshops will be emailed the Zoom link.

          or email us at <a href="mailto:pvfavizindustryfair@tamu.edu" className="link">pvfavizindustryfair@tamu.edu</a> so

          provided that such interviews are related to the student's academic program and provided that
          the interviews are fixed date by employer policy and cannot be rescheduled. <strong>A student may not request excused absences
          for employment or internship interviews for more than one scheduled class meeting in one academic term.</strong>
