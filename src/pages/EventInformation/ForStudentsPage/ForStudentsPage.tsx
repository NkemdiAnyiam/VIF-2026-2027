              and Interactive technologies to connect with prospective employers working in high level positions
              in some of today's leading industries and receive professional feedback on their work.

              <strong>Before you register for the Fair, </strong>please register for our new Professionalism Workshop!
              This workshop serves as an informational for the VIF events and teaches you best practices for communicating with industry professionals.
              To uphold the professional standards of Texas A&M University, current students are <strong>required</strong> to
              attend one of the three professionalism workshops before attending the industry fair or any other VIF event.
              Current students who attempt to register for an event without first attending a workshop day will be removed from the registration list.
              Former students are not required to attend a workshop, but it is encouraged!
              The workshops will be held on the following dates:
            </p>
